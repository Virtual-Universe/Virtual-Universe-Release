;; Similarity checking
;; This is a setting that runs through all of the users and correlates the different parts

;; There are two ways it is done, on login, or on a timer
;; On login checks every time, but it can slow down logins, but it will update the settings every time
;; On timer checks every x minutes (customizable below) and does not lag logins,
