ConsoleCombiner.exe allows you to run multiple regions or grid servers in one
   single console. To set this up, follow the steps below.
   
1. Run ConsoleCombiner.exe once, and press enter when it says that you need to
   set up the config.
   
2. Open up config.xml in your favorite text editor. It should look something like this

<Config xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
  <RegionsToStart>TestRegion1,TestRegion2</RegionsToStart>
  <RegionPorts>9000,9001</RegionPorts>
  <RegionLocation>Universe.exe</RegionLocation>
  <ServerLocations>Universe.AssetServer.exe,Universe.AvatarServer.exe,Universe.GridServer.exe,Universe.InventoryServer.exe,Universe.Server.exe</ServerLocations>
</Config>

3. If you want to set up the ConsoleCombiner to run multiple regions, continue with this step, otherwise, skip to the next step.
   To set up multiple regions, you'll edit the <RegionsToStart> line, adding in any names of regions that you want to start.
   (Make sure NOT to put a space after the ',' in the config!)
   For example, the config above would start TestRegion1 and TestRegion2.
   You will also need to set the <RegionPorts> line, giving each region set above a unique port to use
   (Make sure that you put a port for every region name you put)
   After you have done this, if you have any sim.sim files that you want to load for those regions, you need to rename them to
   the region names you set above.
   For example, in the config above, you'd set the .sim files to "TestRegion1.sim" and "TestRegion2.sim" in the bin directory.
   The regions are now set up, move on to the next step.
 
4. If you want to set up the ConsoleCombiner to run any of the grid services, continue with this step, otherwise, skip to the next step.
   To set up grid services, you'll edit the <ServerLocations> line, but by default, it is set up to run all of the grid services.
   If you want it to just run certain ones, you can remove the .exe names from that line.
   
5. Save config.xml and start ConsoleCombiner.exe again, it'll now be running all of your exe files in one console. Type 'switch console'
   to switch between the different consoles that it is combining.
