Running a Virtual Univere grid locally

(Additional details are provided in 'Customizing.txt')

To run Virtual Universe in Grid mode on your local, internal network ip address,
 you need to specify the HostName address for both the Grid and region server.

There are two methods to use
  1. Automatic detection of your local IP address
  2. Specifying an IP address

  Using 10.0.1.5 as the example local IP, but you should change it to your own,
  if it's different (e.g 192.168.0.100 etc.).

#
# Grid Configuration:
#

Set the HostName under the [Network] section in 'Config/Universe.Server.ini' ,
 removing the 'comment' character if necessary.
examples:
  HostName = localip          // preferred automatic detection
  HostName = 10.0.1.5         // required if your system has multiple IP address allocations

#
# Local Region server only:
#

Set the HostName under the [Network] section in 'Config/Universe.ini' ,
 removing the 'comment' character if necessary.
examples:
HostName = localip          // preferred automatic detection
HostName = 10.0.1.5         // required if your system has multiple IP address allocations

Specify grid mode operation in 'Config/Sim/Main.ini' by commenting the
 'Includes-Standalone' and uncommenting the 'Includes-Grid' lines

e.g.
    ;Include-Standalone = Sim/Standalone/StandaloneCommon.ini

    Include-Grid = Sim/Grid/GridCommon.ini
