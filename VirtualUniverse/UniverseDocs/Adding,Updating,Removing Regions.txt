Adding, Updating, and Removing Regions

Additional regions may be configured on the region server console (Universe.exe)
using the "create region" command.
  This command interactively determines the configuration of your new region and
  will then create and add it to the simulator. The data for this region will be
  saved along with data from existing regions in the 'Data' folder.

If you wish to keep region resources separate, you can add another simulator
 'instance' for your new region.

How to add another region in grid mode:

  Copy the entire 'VirtualUniverse' folder to another location.
  Ensure a clean start by removing all exiting data files from the following folders
    'AssetCache'    : All files and folders
    'Region'        : Any *.sim files
    'RegionBak'     : All files
    'ScriptEngines' : Except for 'Default.lsl' and 'Test.lsl', All files and folders
    'SQLite'        : All files

	Manually edit the new instance configuration as per normal setup.
  Alternatively, run the simulator server (Universe.exe) manually specifying '-configuration' to reconfigure
  the simulator to your requirements.
    Universe.exe -configure

  Note:
  Ensure that the main (base) port is different than any existing simulator instances
      This is normally port 9000
  Edit Config/Sim/Grid/GridInfo.ini and enter the address of your grid server.

How to remove a region in grid mode:

	To remove a region, simply don't start that region's Universe.exe file, and to remove it from the map, switch to
	Universe.Server.exe and type 'grid clear region <name>'.

How to update a region:

  To update region information such as Name, Position, etc, type 'update region info' on the region console.
	To update estate information, such as the estate you are in, type 'change estate' on the region console.
