##  Creating an avatar archive
##
To create an avatar archive.
  1. You need to set up a user on your sim that will be wearing all of the
     clothing and attachments that you want the archive to have.
     - It might be a good idea to create a new user for this purpose.
  2. Once suitably attired, take a snapshot of your avatar that shows the final
     appearance. Note down the UUID of the snapshot or copy it to the clipboard.

After this is done, the command to save the avatar archive is...
   save avatar archive [<First> <Last> [<Filename>]] [FolderNameToSaveInto] (--snapshot <UUID>) (--private) (--portable)
 - For easier use a shortened version will be used and you will be prompted for any missing details

  3. Save the avatar archive by entering the console command (grid server or standalone server)
    save avatar archive --snapshot <The_UUID_You_Noted_Above>

    - You will be prompted for the user's First and Last Name
    - Then for the name of the archive file

    After these prompts you will see the details of what has been saved to the avatar archive

This will create the avatar archive in the folder 'Data/AvatarArchives' and will
  now be available in the new user registration of the WebUI.
  - The archive will also be available for the 'load avatar archive' command.

The full command details
    <First> is the first name of the user to save
    <Last> is the last name of the user to save
    <Filename> is the file that you want to save it into
      - defaults to '.aa' and will save to the 'Data/AvatarArchives' folder
      - Accepts absolute or relative path names for other folders
    <FolderNameToSaveInfo> is the folder name that will be created when this is
       loaded to a new user.

  The last parameters are optional with only the --snapshot option necessary for
    setting up avatar selections for the WebUI.
   --snapshot <UUID>  - will assign a screenshot to the archive, allowing a picture
                        of it to be set for the web interface.
   --private          - will not allow the archive to be found by the WebUI for use
                        as a default avatar.
   --portable         - Create a portable archive (Still under development)


##
##  Setting up default avatars
##
Once you have followed the steps above for all default avatars you are all set.
  The saved avatars will now show up in the user registration page, available for selection.

Note: The avatar archives must be saved to the default folder to be available in the WebUI.



##
##  Loading an avatar archive
##
If you want to load an avatar archive to a user (and replace their current appearance), you can load
an archive. To do this, make sure that the user is not logged in, then type the following into the console

'load avatar archive <First> <Last> <Filename>'
       or
'load avatar archive' and then fill in the prompts

  <First>      The first name of the user to be set to the avatar
  <Last>       The last name of the user to be set to the avatar
  <Filename>   The avatar archive file that you want to load (extension of '.aa' is optional).
               Note: Unless a full filename is specified, the 'Data/AvatarArchice'
                     folder will be the default location for avatar archives
  Details will be shown of the loading of the appearance from the avatar archive.
  When next login occurs, the user avatar will be wearing the clothes from the archive.
