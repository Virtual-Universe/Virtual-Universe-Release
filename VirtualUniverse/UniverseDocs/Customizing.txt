Virtual Universe configuration options
===============================

To tailor the standard Virtual Universe configuration to you own personal setup,
modify the following configuration files..

For the standard 'Standalone' configuration

Directory: Config/Sim
*********

# If you are using MySql or MariaDB as your database #
 /Data/MySql.ini :	Change the MySql connection details to your setup - This is for the Simulator services

 	  ConnectionString = "Data Source=127.0.0.1;Port=3306;Database=<universe databasename>;User ID=<database user>;Password=<user password>;Charset=utf8;"

	<Data Source>                :  The Url or IP address of the server (e.g. mysql.mydomain.com / 192.168.1.200)
	<Port>                       :  The default standard is 3306, change if your server has been configured to listen on another port
    <universe databasename>      :  The database name that you have created
    <database user>			     :  The user that has permission to access the <universe databasename>
    <user password>			     :  The password for the whitecore user
	<Charset>                    :  This should be left as utf8

# Simulator Names #
 /Standalone/GridInfoService.ini : Change the grid name and nickname
      gridname = "Virtual Universe"
      gridnick = "universe"

 /Standalone/StandaloneCommon.ini : Change the welcome message sent to the viewer on login
 			WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to Virtual Universe, <USERNAME>!"

# Simulator host address #
 /Universe.ini :
	To automatically find the external address of your system, comment this hostname entry out (default)
 			Add comment ';' -> ;HostName = 127.0.0.1

	To specify a hostname for the simulator
	    HostName = universe.mydomain.com     (Replace with your registered domain name)

	To Use the local IP address of the system you are running on
			HostName = localip

	To use as specific IP address for network or multi adapter setups
			HostName = 192.168.1.200 (replace with the required IP address)

Grid Mode setup
===============

To change to a grid mode setup, modify the following...

Directory:  Config/Grid/ServerConfiguration
**********

# If you are using MySql or MariaDB as your database #
 /Data/MySql.ini :	Change the MySql connection details to your setup
 					- This is for the grid services and normally is the same as per the Simulator service configuration

			ConnectionString = "Data Source=127.0.0.1;Port=3306;Database=<universe databasename>;User ID=<database user>;Password=<user password>;Charset=utf8;"

   <Data Source>                :  The Url or IP address of the server (e.g. mysql.mydomain.com / 192.168.1.200)
   <Port>                       :  The default standard is 3306, change if your server has been configured to listen on another port
   <universe databasename>      :  The database name that you have created
   <database user>			    :  The user that has permission to access the <universe databasename>
   <user password>			    :  The password for the universe user
   <Charset>                    :  This should be left as utf8

# Grid Names #
/GridInfoService.ini : Change the grid name and nickname
    gridname = "Virtual Universe"
    gridnick = "universe"

/Login.ini : The welcome message sent to a viewer on login
    WelcomeMessage = "Welcome to Virtual Universe, <USERNAME>!"

You need to change the simulator setup from Standalone to grid mode

Directory: Config/Sim
*********

  /Main.ini : change includes from Standalone to Grid mode
	    	Add comment   ';' ->	 ;Include-Standalone = Configuration/Standalone/StandaloneCommon.ini
			Remove comment  ';' ->    Include-Grid = Configuration/Grid/UniverseGridCommon.ini

 /Grid/GridCommon.ini :  If you are not running the Grid services on the same system as the simulator, you
 								  will need to change the Address of where to find the GridServerURI.
								  (Please leave the port as 8012)

		[Configuration]
		GridServerURI = "http://127.0.0.1:8012/grid/"

Advanced configuration
======================

There are many additional configuration settings to enable or modify to your requirements.
Check out the example .ini files for these.
