# Contributor Code of Conduct

The Second Galaxy Development Team is committed to providing a quality open-source alternative to the various open-source virtual world simulator projects that focuses on quality and community involvement.  To this end, as contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a good experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience or gender.

The core developers of the Second Galaxy Development Team have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

# Acceptable contributions to this project

The Second Galaxy Development Team has adopted a strict set of standards to ensure the Virtual Universe community is developed with a ethical set of values.  The following are required at all times of core developers, Partners, third party developers, contributors, and community members:

Contributing patches and code

* All commits must be pushed under the username of the individual authoring the commit.
* When a pull request is submitted the Core Developers of the Second Galaxy Development Team will review the revisions contained in the commit and comment on the pull request when changes are needed.  Upon 3 core developers being satisfied with the commit the pull request will be merged to retain the original author’s name.
* No one may take credit for work they did not author themselves.  Anyone caught doing this will see their pull requests rejected.
* Licensing – All new code files must be submitted using the EmptyClass.cs to ensure the licensing remains intact.  No code file where code is added, revised, or removed may have the license text altered in any way.  Pull requests which contained altered text in the license will be rejected.  If you are adding your website url to the license text in that file please add it at the end of the line with the website urls in the license text in the respective .cs file.  Do not alter the License.txt files but rather submit a license.txt file in VirtualUniverse/Licenses/ folder.  An example of the name of your license.txt file is: MyLicense.txt.  The word License must be in the name of your new license.txt file.
* Commenting on pull requests – Everyone may comment on a pull request, however we ask that you keep comments on topic of the pull request and the revisions proposed in the code.

Issues

* All issues must be about bugs, feature requests, questions, etc and can be filed on the issue tracker on our github repository.  Remember not to panic if you do not get a response right away as core developers are usually hard at work.  We will respond to each and every individual issue.  Issues will be assigned to the core developer having development oversight of the code relating to the issue submitted.
* When opening an issue you must provide the following:
	* Description of the issue your encountering (or question)
	* Any relevant error or warning messages received in your console. (remember some errors and warnings will not show up when the log level is set to info so you will need to set your console’s log level to debug using the command set log level debug on the console.)
	* Whether you are running in grid or standalone mode (if you have a custom configuration please note this to)
	* Database your using (i.e. SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, etc)
	* Operating system of the machine where your servers are running. (NOTE: Please be specific on your operating system such as the OS name i.e. Ubuntu or Windows 10 and the bit type such as x86 or x64).
	* If the issue is encountered during your interaction in-world please tell us what viewer your using.
	* The steps you took to produce the issue.
	* If possible, please attach any pictures you may have showing the issue and or the logs that give the error message for us to review.
	* The version of Virtual Universe your using.  (this means date, build version, etc.) If you pulled direct from the github repository and built the solution then please provide the commit number your using so we can pin point if the error still exists in later commits.
* If you find a fix to the issue please let us know on the issue
* When commenting on issues please make sure your comments are on the topic of the actual issue and are not going off the topic of the issue.
* Do not attack other members of the Virtual Universe community when they comment on the issues or the core developers.  This is considered inappropriate and unnecessary nor will it be tolerated.
* When submitting a feature request please providing the following:
	* A description of the feature
	* What would the feature do?
	* Why you think the feature would be useful
	* How will the feature help make Virtual Universe better?
	* Has another virtual world simulator community implemented a similar feature?
	* If another virtual world simulator project has implemented a similar feature please provide a url to the feature description and if possible code for us to look at
* The feature request will remain open for members of the community to comment on.  It takes 3 core developers of the Second Galaxy Development Team to vote in favor of the feature being requested for it to be included.  If it is approved for implementation it may not get implemented right away but will be added to the list of new features for implementation.

IRC Chat

As always we can be found in #galaxyfutures on Freenode.  This channel is meant for community members to obtain help and support from fellow community members and the development team.  

The following rules apply in IRC:

* Treat others how you want to be treated at all times
* Treat others with respect
* No discriminatory or derogatory language is allowed at any time
* General discussion is allowed in the IRC channel, however when someone asks a question you are asked to pause the general discussion so the person asking for help can get the help they are looking for
* There are times members of the development team may not respond due to being away from their desks or in another window.  Please rest assured it is not intended as a means of being rude.  We will respond as quickly as we are able to.
* We do monitor our IRC channels and do review the chat logs.  We will block anyone from entering our IRC channels who violate our policies.

Financial Donations

The Virtual Universe Open Source Project is funded through the line item budget process of the Second Galaxy Development Team in its annual fiscal operating budget.  For more information on donations please contact EmperorStarfinder in IRC.
